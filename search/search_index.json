This lab is considered an advanced lab. Take your time completing each of the steps. You have 24 hours to complete the lab with your pod user. The lab content will be available to you even after your pod is no longer available. </p> <p>In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with Webex Contact Center's advanced AI solutions. This lab is designed to help you understand the Cisco Text-to-Speech engine and explore the capabilities of the Webex AI Agent, which utilizes built-in and proprietary models as well as natural language processing (NLP). You'll learn how to seamlessly escalate conversations from an AI agent to a human agent, ensuring efficient and intelligent customer interactions. </p> <p>In addition, we will cover several exciting AI-driven features such as Agent Wellness, which supports the well-being of agents during interactions, and Call Drop Summary, a feature that captures and summarizes previous dropped calls. These innovations demonstrate the power of AI in enhancing both customer and agent experiences. </p> <p>To further enhance your learning, we have included bonus lab content. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with our Supervisor Desktop, future enhancements to streamline Agent and Supervisor sign-in, and future AI Agent capabilities. </p> <p>Let\u2019s dive in and explore how Webex AI is shaping the future of customer service and agent support. </p>"},{"location":"advanced/Lab1/#disclaimer","title":"Disclaimer","text":"<p>Although the lab design and configuration examples could be used as a reference, for design related questions please contact your representative at Cisco, or a Cisco partner.</p>"},{"location":"graphics/Lab1/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"graphics/Lab2/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"graphics/download/1/","title":"1","text":""},{"location":"graphics/overview/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"graphics/temp/dummy/","title":"Dummy","text":""},{"location":"main/AIAgentTrack_Mission1/","title":"Mission 1: Create AI Autonomous Agent.

Specifically, we will work with the Address Book feature.</p> <p></p>Good to Know [Optional]<p></p> <p>Understanding API Calls with Real-Life Comparisons</p> <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different systems to communicate by sending and receiving structured requests. Here are the most common API call types, explained with real-world analogies:</p> <ol> <li> <p>GET \u2013 Retrieving Information Analogy: Checking your bank balance at an ATM. You request information, and the system provides it without making any changes. Example Use Case: Retrieving a customer\u2019s interaction history in Webex Contact Center before routing their call.</p> </li> <li> <p>POST \u2013 Creating New Data Analogy: Ordering a new item online. You submit details, and a new order (or record) is created in the system. Example Use Case: Creating a new customer support ticket when an issue is reported during a call.</p> </li> <li> <p>PUT \u2013 Updating Existing Data Analogy: Changing your home address in an online banking system. Instead of adding a new address, the existing one is replaced. Example Use Case: Updating a customer\u2019s preferred contact method in a CRM system.</p> </li> <li> <p>PATCH \u2013 Modifying Partial Data Analogy: Updating your phone number on a social media profile without changing other details like your name or email. Example Use Case: Changing only the priority level of an existing support ticket.</p> </li> <li> <p>DELETE \u2013 Removing Data Analogy: Canceling a hotel reservation. The record is removed, preventing further use. Example Use Case: Deleting a scheduled callback request if the customer no longer needs assistance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Webhooks \u2013 Automated Notifications Analogy: Receiving an SMS alert when your package is out for delivery. Instead of requesting updates repeatedly, you get notified when something happens. Example Use Case: Notifying an agent when a VIP customer joins the queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>SEARCH API (GraphQL Queries) \u2013 Retrieving Specific Data Efficiently Analogy: Using a restaurant menu app to filter only \"vegan dishes under $10\" instead of browsing the entire menu. Unlike traditional GET requests that return all data, GraphQL allows users to request exactly what they need. Example Use Case: Searching for all unresolved support tickets assigned to a specific agent without loading unnecessary ticket details.</p> </li> </ol> <p>APIs streamline operations by automating tasks, integrating systems, and enhancing customer experiences. Understanding these core calls helps optimize workflows in platforms like Webex Contact Center. </p><p></p>"},{"location":"main/APITrack_DeveloperPortal/#build","title":"Build","text":""},{"location":"main/APITrack_DeveloperPortal/#create-a-new-address-book-entity-by-using-post","title":"Create a New Address Book entity by using POST","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Open Developer Portal and click on Sign In.

Starting with the Basic Call Routing mission, you explored foundational features like flow templates, Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities, language and voice options.</p> <p>From there, you enhanced your skills with missions such as:</p> <ul> <li>Using Business Hours to introduce flexibility and adaptability to your flows.</li> <li>Implementing skill-based routing to select proper agent based on their skills and proficiency level.</li> <li>Leveraging Event Flows to dynamically handle real-time events.</li> <li>Designing and implementing a Post Call Survey to gather actionable customer feedback.</li> <li>Embedding a subflow into the main flow to simplify flow development, reduce main flow size making it cleaner and easier to manage.</li> <li>You also worked extensively with the Flow Designer Tools, gaining confidence in navigating, troubleshooting, and optimizing flows.</li> </ul> <p>By completing these missions, you\u2019ve not only developed a deep understanding of Webex Contact Center features but also acquired practical skills to harness its capabilities in real-world scenarios.</p> <p>Should you need further assistance or have questions, feel free to reach out or join discussions in the Webex community. We\u2019re here to support your success as you continue to explore and implement these powerful tools in your future projects.</p> <p>Thank you for participating in the CORE Track, and we encourage you to continue exploring and building on these foundational skills as you progress through the next stages of the Webex Contact Center Flow Designer Lab!</p>"},{"location":"main/CoreTrack_Mission1/","title":"Mission 1: Basic Call Routing (Flow Template, TTS, Language)","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The input in the images that follow are only examples.

Instead, a third-party application, such as WxConnect, was required to make an API call back to the WxCC API Gateway. The third-party application utilized the HTTP POST method to communicate with the WxCC API Gateway. Now, this functionality is directly supported within the Flow, allowing API calls to be made to the WxCC API Gateway without the need for an intermediary application. This simplifies the configuration process and eliminates an additional potential point of failure.</p>"},{"location":"main/Lab2/#how-it-was","title":"How it was","text":""},{"location":"main/Lab2/#how-it-is-now","title":"How it is now","text":""},{"location":"main/Lab2/#_1","title":"Lab2","text":""},{"location":"main/Lab3/","title":"Introductory Lab","text":""},{"location":"main/Lab3/#introductory-lab","title":"Introductory Lab","text":""},{"location":"main/Lab3/#another-task","title":"Another Task","text":"<p>Some more example</p>"},{"location":"main/LabRoom_Setup/","title":"LAB ROOM SETUP","text":""},{"location":"main/LabRoom_Setup/#steps-to-setup-each-laptop-in-the-room","title":"Steps to setup each laptop in the room.","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Download and save on desktop a txt file for current pod from User Credentials.
