# Using Webex Contact Center Developer Portal

## Story

Webex Contact Center APIs enable automation, customization, and integration with external applications. By leveraging these APIs, administrators can streamline processes, enhance agent efficiency, and improve customer interactions. In this lab, we will explore how to interact with the Developer Portal and execute API calls to manage Address Books.


## Mission Details
In this mission, attendees will learn how to interact with Webex Contact Center APIs by performing API calls via the  [**Developer Portal**](https://developer.webex-cx.com/){:target="_blank"}. Specifically, we will work with the Address Book feature.

**Address Book Overview**
Address Book is available in the Webex Contact Center Agent Desktop. Agents can make outbound calls using Address Books, selecting numbers from pre-configured lists instead of entering them manually in the 'Start a New Call' field. Administrators can configure and manage Address Books via the Webex Contact Center APIs.


## Build

1. Access the Developer Portal

2. Create a New Address Book (POST)

3. Update Address Book Description (PUT)

4. Create a New Address Book Entry (POST)

5. Retrieve Address Book Entry by ID (GET)

## Summary
This lab shows how to quickly change the behavior of your contact center logic in extreme situation without even login-in in to Control Hub.
