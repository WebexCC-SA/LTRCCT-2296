## Call Flow Overview

1. A new call enters the flow. </br>
2. The flow executes the logic to enable survey functionality.</br>
3. Agent answers the call.</br>
4. The flow triggers an event when the agent disconnects from the call.</br>
5. The caller remains on the line and hears the survey menu.</br>

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:

1. Integrate a preconfigured survey into the call flow using the Flow Designer.
2. Configure basic logic to determine when to route customers to the survey (e.g., after a call ends).
3. Understand how Webex Contact Center supports various survey question types, including CSAT, CES, and NPS.

!!! Note
    The survey is prebuilt and includes key questions designed to gather actionable insights from customers. Your task is to focus on configuring the flow and ensuring the survey is triggered seamlessly during the customer journey.

### Pre-configured entities      
     
- Survey: **Webex CC 2025**

## Build
1. Switch to the Control Hub then go to **Contact Center**. Navigate to the **Surveys** under the **Customer Experience** section. Locate **Webex CC PCS** survey and click on it to familiarise yourself with its configuration.

  ![profiles](../graphics/Lab1/L1M4_PCS_Explore.gif)

2. Switch to the Flow Designer. Open your **<span class="attendee-id-container">Main_Flow_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-prefix="Main_Flow_">Your_Attendee_ID</span><span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**, make sure **Edit** toggle is **ON**.

3. Add Global Variable **Global_FeedbackSurveyOptIn** to your flow.

  ![profiles](../graphics/Lab1/L1M4_PCS_Add_GV.gif)

4. Delete the connection between the **NewPhoneContact** node and the first **Set Variable** node we used to set language preference. Then drag new **Set Variable** node from the activity library on the left to flow canvas, put it between **NewPhoneContact** and existing **Set Variable** nodes and connect all three nodes into a chain.

  ![profiles](../graphics/Lab1/L1M4_PCS_Add_SetVariable.gif)

5. Click on the new **Set Variable** node you have just added and configure the following fields:

    > - Variable: **Global_FeedbackSurveyOptIn**<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Global_FeedbackSurveyOptIn"><span class="copy"></span></span>
    >
    > - Set Value: **true**

    ![profiles](../graphics/Lab1/L1M4_PCS_Set_GV.gif)

6. Add a Post Call Survey functionality to the flow:

    > - Open **Event FLows**  tab and locate pre-defined **AgentDisconected** event node marked with light green crossed-out headset icon. If you completed previous mission you should have **HTTP Request** node connected to it.
    >
    > - Delete the connection between **HTTP Request** and **DisconnectContact** nodes.
    >
    > - Drag **Feedback V2** from the activity library on the left, place it between **HTTP Request** and **DisconnectContact** nodes and connect all three nodes into a chain.
    >
    > - Click on **Feedback V2** node and configure Survey Method as **Voice Based** and select **Webex CC PCS**<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Webex CC PCS"><span class="copy"></span></span> from the dropdown list.

7. Let's configure the voice message that will be played to the caller if something goes wrong with **Webex CC PCS** survey:

    > - Drag **Play Message** node from the activity library and place it below **Feedback V2** node you have just added.
    >
    > - Connect **Undefined Error** output of the **Feedback V2** node to the input of the **Play Message** node
    >
    > - Connect the output of the **Play Message** node to the **DisconnectContact** node.
    
    Then click on the **Play Message** node and configure the following fields:
    
    > - Enable Text-To-Speech
    >
    > - Connector: Cisco Cloud Text-to-Speech
    >
    > - Click the Add Text-to-Speech Message button and paste text: ***Something went wrong on Feedback node. Please call later.***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Something went wrong on Feedback node. Please call later."><span class="copy"></span></span>
    >
    > - Delete the selection for Audio File

8. Validate and publish the flow:

    > - Enable the **Validation** toggle in the bottom right corner of the flow designer window to check for any potential flow errors and recommendations.
    >
    > - If there are no **Flow Errors** after validation is complete, click on **Publish Flow** next to it.
    >
    > - In the pop-up window, ensure that the **Latest** label is selected in the **Add Label Label(s)** list, then click **Publish Flow**.

## Testing
1. Your Agent desktop session should be still active but if not, use Webex CC Desktop application ![profiles](../graphics/overview/Desktop_Icon40x40.png) and login with agent credentials you have been provided **wxcclabs+agent_ID<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>@gmail.com** and become **Available** 
2. Make a test call to the Support Number and accept the call by Agent.
3. Finish the call by Agent so the caller could stay on the line. 
4. Now the caller should hear prompts configured in **Webex CC PCS**. Complete the survey.
5. To check survey responses, switch to the **Control Hub** and navigate to the **Surveys** under **Customer Experience** section. Locate the **Webex CC PCS** survey and click on the **Download** button on the right hand side to download a CSV file with the provided Survey responses.
    
    !!! Note
        If you create your own survey, as described in the Optional section of this mission, you might not see the survey responses immediately, as there is a delay in edited surveys.

**Congratulations on completing another mission where we have learnt how Post Call Survey can be implemented.**
