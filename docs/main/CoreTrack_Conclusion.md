# Conclusion 

We hope you enjoyed the hands-on experience of the CORE TRACK of Webex Contact Center lab. Throughout this lab, you’ve gained valuable insights into building and configuring essential elements of Webex Contact Center workflows. Starting with the Basic Call Routing mission, you explored foundational features like flow templates, Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities, language and voice options.

From there, you enhanced your skills with missions such as:

 - **Using Business Hours** to introduce flexibility and adaptability to your flows.</br>
 - **Implementing skill-based routing** to select proper agent based on their skills and proficiency level.
 - **Leveraging Event Flows** to dynamically handle real-time events.</br>
 - **Designing and implementing a Post Call Survey** to gather actionable customer feedback.</br>
 - **Embedding a subflow into the main flow** to simplify flow development, reduce main flow size making it cleaner and easier to manage.
 - You also worked extensively with the Flow Designer Tools, gaining confidence in navigating, troubleshooting, and optimizing flows.</br>

By completing these missions, you’ve not only developed a deep understanding of Webex Contact Center features but also acquired practical skills to harness its capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Should you need further assistance or have questions, feel free to reach out or join discussions in the Webex community. We’re here to support your success as you continue to explore and implement these powerful tools in your future projects.

Thank you for participating in the CORE TRACK, and we encourage you to continue exploring and building on these foundational skills as you progress through the next stages of the Webex Contact Center Flow Designer Lab!
