##Flow Analytics Overview

Flow Analytics feature is designed to provide flow developer, administrators and supervisors with a comprehensive, graphical view of how Flow paths are being utilized across all customer interactions. This feature will enable better analysis of IVR flow operations, helping to identify areas for improvement and increase self-service containment. The feature provides an aggregated view that allows users to:

  - Analyze traces aggregated over a period of time.
  - Visualize the aggregated data in a flow diagram, with various metrics like, average call duration, error percentage, along with some activities level metrics. 
  - Show interaction traces for a selected activity.
  - Switch between multiple versions of analytics views.
  - Color-coded links between activities based on the number of activity executions, and status.
