### What is an Event Flow?

An Event Flow in Webex Contact Center is a workflow triggered by specific events in the customer interaction process, such as call arrival, agent assignment, call disconnection or actions within the IVR.

Event flows enable a wide range of scenarios, with one common use case being the ability to update an external database with data collected during a call—either from the IVR or through interaction with a live agent.

In this mission, we’ll use **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/){:target="_blank"}**, a tool that acts as a temporary mailbox for online notifications, to capture and test data sent via webhooks. We’ll send a simple **POST** request containing call data and information provided by the agent during the call.

### Configuration

1. Create a **Global Variable** by accessing Flows then Global Variable tab
    
    > Name: **<span class="attendee-id-container">WhoIsCalling_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-prefix="WhoIsCalling_">Your_Attendee_ID</span><span class="copy"></span></span>**
    >
    > Variable Type: **String**
    >
    > Make agent viewable: **Yes**
    >
    > Desktop label: **Who Is Calling?**<span class="copy copy-icon" data-copy-text="Who Is Calling?"></span>
    >
    > Edit on Desktop: **Yes**
        
        
2. Open you your **Main_Flow_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>** or refresh the Flow Designer page to make sure new created Global Variables are being populated. Add **WhoIsCalling_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>** Global Variable to the flow.

3. Open New Browser tab and paste the following URL **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/){:target="_blank"}**. Then click on **Your unique URL** to make a copy of URL. 
**<span style="color: red;">DO NOT Close this Tab</span>**

4. Go back to your flow and navigate to Even Flow tab, remove connection between **AgentDisconnect** and **EndFlow_xkf** and add **HTTP Request** node in between these nodes.
      
    > Use Authenticated Endpoint: **Off**
    >
    > Request URL: *<span style="color: red;">Paste your unique URL copied on Step 3 from https://webhook.site/</span>*.
    >
    > Method: **POST**
    >
    > Content Type: **Application/JSON**
    >
    > Request Body:  
    ```JSON
    {
    "DNIS":"{{NewPhoneContact.DNIS}}",
    "ANI":"{{NewPhoneContact.ANI}}",
    "InteractionId":"{{NewPhoneContact.InteractionId}}",
    "Language":"{{Global_Language}}",
    "WhoCalls":"{{WhoIsCalling}}"
    }
    ```

    !!! Note
        We are building a dictionary with values generated by flow, language we set in main lab and also WhoIsCalling value which will be provided by agent in agent desktop.

5. <span style="color: orange;">[Optional]</span>: You can also modify **Screenpop** configuration in the same flow

    > URL Settings: **[https://www.ciscolive.com/emea/faqs.html](https://www.ciscolive.com/emea/faqs.html){:target="_blank"}**<span class="copy copy-icon" data-copy-text="https://www.ciscolive.com/emea/faqs.html"></span>
    >
    > Screen Pop Desktop Label: **Cisco Live Amsterdam 2025 FAQ**<span class="copy copy-icon" data-copy-text="Cisco Live Amsterdam 2025 FAQ"></span>
    >
    > Display Settings: New browser Tab.

7. Validate the flow by clicking **Validate**, **Publish** and select the Latest version of the flow
    
### Testing
    
1. Make sure you're logged into Webex CC Desktop application as Agent **wxcclabs+agent_ID<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>@gmail.com** and set status to **Available**.
2. Make a call to the Support Number and if success you should hear Welcome message and then accept the call by agent.
3. In agent interaction panel change **Who Is Calling?** to any text you like then click **Save** and End the call.
4. On **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/){:target="_blank"}** you should see the request which came right after Agent dropped the call with all the needed data
