### What is an Event Flow?

An Event Flow in Webex Contact Center is a workflow triggered by specific events in the customer interaction process, such as call arrival, agent assignment, call disconnection or actions within the IVR.

Event flows enable a wide range of scenarios, with one common use case being the ability to update an external database with data collected during a call—either from the IVR or through interaction with a live agent.

In this mission, we’ll utilize **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/){:target="_blank"}**, a free online tool that generates a temporary, unique URL for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests. It’s widely used by developers and testers for debugging and testing webhooks or other HTTP-based APIs.

### Configuration

!!! Note:
     The **Global Variable** with name **WhoIsCalling** that we are going to use in this mission has been already created. Switch to **Control Hub** and navigate to **Flows** under Customer Experience section. Select Global Variables on top and search for **WhoIsCalling** to observe it's configuration. You <span style="color: orange;">**DO NOT**</span> need to modify it here.
             
1. Open you your **Main_Flow_<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>** or refresh the Flow Designer page to make sure new created Global Variables are being populated. Add <span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="WhoIsCalling"><span class="copy"></span></span> Global Variable to the flow.

2. Open New Browser tab and paste the following URL **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/){:target="_blank"}**. Then click on **Your unique URL** to make a copy of URL. 
**<span style="color: red;">DO NOT Close this Tab</span>**

3. Go back to your flow and navigate to Even Flow tab, remove connection between **AgentDisconnect** and **EndFlow_xkf** and add **HTTP Request** node in between these nodes.
      
    > Use Authenticated Endpoint: **Off**
    >
    > Request URL: *<span style="color: red;">Paste your unique URL copied on Step 3 from https://webhook.site/</span>*.
    >
    > Method: **POST**
    >
    > Content Type: **Application/JSON**
    >
    > Request Body:  
    ```JSON
    {
    "DNIS": "{{NewPhoneContact.DNIS}}",
    "ANI": "{{NewPhoneContact.ANI}}",
    "InteractionId": "{{NewPhoneContact.InteractionId}}",
    "Language": "{{Global_Language}}",
    "WhoCalls": "{{WhoIsCalling}}"
    }
    ```

    !!! Note
        We are building a dictionary with values generated by flow, language we set in main lab and also WhoIsCalling value which will be provided by agent in agent desktop.

7. Validate the flow by clicking **Validate**, **Publish** and select the Latest version of the flow
    
### Testing
    
1. Make sure you're logged into Webex CC Desktop application as Agent **wxcclabs+agent_ID<span class="attendee-id-placeholder">Your_Attendee_ID</span>@gmail.com** and set status to **Available**.
2. Make a call to the Support Number and if success you should hear Welcome message and then accept the call by agent.
3. In agent interaction panel change **Who Is Calling?** to any text you like then click **Save** and End the call.
4. On **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/){:target="_blank"}** you should see the request which came right after Agent dropped the call with all the needed data
